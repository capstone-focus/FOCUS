values ('1776', 'David McCullough', '1776 tells the story of an early and crucial year in the American Revolution, whose outcome made possible the ultimate victory of the American side seven years later. The book focuses principally on the Continental Army, specifically those men under the direct command of General George Washington during the first 15 months of the American Revolutionary War, with a particular emphasis on the titular year. By telling the story of the soldiers rather than the signers of the Declaration of Independence in Philadelphia, 1776 makes clear how precarious and uncertain the situation was even as the momentous words of the Declaration of Independence were being composed. Against the longest odds imaginable, Washington managed to expel the British from Boston and then, despite a series of misjudgments and setbacks, was able to preserve his ragtag army in the face of superior opposition until the end of the campaigning season in early January 1777.');

values (1,1, 'Summary\n\nThe book begins with a description of the royal procession that took King George III of England to the Palace of Westminster for his address to Parliament on October 26, 1775. It is a display of power and wealth the likes of which the world rarely sees, as if ''the very grandeur, wealth, and weight of the British Empire were rolling past.'' George III is not the dullard that he would often be portrayed as, but rather a genial man of sophisticated but not extravagant tastes. As the unrest in the colonies worsens, George III feels the need to play the ''patriot-king,'' and he firmly believes that ''America must be made to obey.'' Despite sympathy for the American colonists from some members, there is general agreement among the body that Parliament''s authority over the colonies is supreme—which is precisely what the restive colonists reject.\n\n\nIn his speech George III effectively declares the colonies to be in rebellion against Great Britain and suggests they are trying to establish ''an independent empire.'' He also announces that he is sending additional land and naval forces to put an end to the unrest that had turned violent at Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775, and that had been compounded by bloodshed at the Battle of Bunker Hill in mid-June. Indeed, George III is so committed to a military solution that he refuses to grant an audience to an American emissary seeking the king''s intervention in what the colonists claim to be a quarrel between themselves and Parliament, not the crown. The king''s declaration produces conflicting reactions in Parliament, especially in the House of Commons, where those who sympathize with the American colonists sharply criticize the government''s handling of the crisis.\n\n\nThe prime minster, Lord North, observes the proceedings equably. ''It was Parliament as theater,'' and Lord North knows the king''s policy has the support of the majority, regardless of the dramatic rhetoric some members of Parliament display. North, although tasked to ''explain and defend'' King George III''s position, has misgivings about the goal of extinguishing the Americans'' discontent through military force, even if it is accompanied by ''offers of mercy upon a proper submission.'' Nevertheless, North will lead the king''s government throughout the war, writing that he is ''convinced in my own conscience that our cause is just and important.'' To assist him in that effort, shortly after his speech the king appoints Lord George Germain to serve as secretary for the American colonies. A former soldier, Germain believes the rebellious colonists must be dealt a ''decisive blow.''\n\nAnalysis\n\nKing George III''s address to Parliament is not the cause of the events that will be detailed in 1776. McCullough chooses it for his opening scene because the decision to pursue a more aggressive policy toward the colonies confirms, for the colonists, their sense of alienation from Great Britain. It makes the possibility of a peaceful settlement—for which some on both sides still hope in this time period—less likely. For the reader who doesn''t know the history of prerevolutionary America, McCullough does not spend much time filling in the blanks. "War had come on April 19, with the first blood shed at Lexington and Concord," he writes, using passive-voice constructions that present the war almost as a natural phenomenon for which no particular historical actors or forces are responsible. Likewise, McCullough states, "British troops remained under siege at Boston," but not that Boston had been occupied by the British army and the Massachusetts provincial government suspended by act of Parliament in response to earlier turmoil. About that unrest—and the political views that animated it—1776 has little to say. Throughout the book McCullough recounts but does not quite explain how the reader got here. The book is not a history book so much as a narrative history, driven by characters and actions. King George III is one of those characters, and it is his action—his decision to increase Britain''s military efforts in America—that sets McCullough''s story in motion. A key to George III''s character is given in the chapter title: "Sovereign Duty." Whatever else he may have been—and McCullough dismisses the reductive caricature posterity handed down, especially in the United States—here he is a man with a strong sense of his role as monarch and what it requires of him. As a ruler he is "sincerely patriotic and everlastingly duty-bound." The word duty recurs a handful of times in just the few pages McCullough spends sketching the king''s view of the American problem. It is his duty to maintain the authority of the crown and the peace throughout his kingdom, with respect to which, he wrote Lord North, "any other conduct but compelling obedience would be ruinous." McCullough uses duty as well when describing the motivations of Parliament in approving the king''s policy and of General William Howe in accepting command of the British forces in America despite his own objections. This whole chapter is told if not from a British perspective then with an almost exclusive focus on the political situation in Britain. The only real political debate in a book about the year in which the Declaration of Independence was signed happens in the British Parliament rather than the Continental Congress. And even that debate was weakened by corruption, patronage, and the spoils system.');
